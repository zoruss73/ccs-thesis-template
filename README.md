# 📘 Thesis Documentation Template (Markdown + MkDocs)

Welcome to the **Thesis Documentation Template** — a modern, modular, and GitHub-friendly way to write your thesis using:

- **Markdown** for clean writing  
- **MkDocs + Material theme** for beautiful documentation  
- **GitHub + GitHub Pages** for tracking progress and publishing  
- **GitHub Actions** for validating and deploying automatically  

This template follows a **standard academic thesis format** and breaks every section into separate Markdown files for clarity and maintainability.

2. Select **Pages**
3. Under *Build & Deployment*:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `gh-pages`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Save

Your thesis will be published at:

```
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```
